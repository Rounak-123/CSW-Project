                <div class="content">
                    Cricket is played between two teams of 11 players. Each team bats and bowls once in a single innings. The batting team scores runs by hitting the ball bowled by the opposing team and running between the wickets. The fielding team tries to get the batters out by catching the ball, bowling them out, or running them out. The team with the most runs at the end of the innings wins.

                    Cricket boasts three primary formats:

 * One Day Internationals (ODIs): A limited-overs format where each team bats for 50 overs. It's a faster-paced game emphasizing skill, speed, and strategic batting and bowling.
 * Twenty20 (T20): The shortest format, with each team batting for just 20 overs. It's known for its explosive nature, big hits, and high-scoring matches. It's the most popular format for attracting new fans to the sport.

                <h5 class="card-title">What is the difference between no  ball and wide ball?</h5>
                <div class="content">
                    No-ball and wide ball are two types of illegal deliveries in cricket.
                    * No-ball: Occurs when the bowler oversteps the crease while delivering the ball. The batting team gets an extra run and the batsman cannot be dismissed on that delivery except for a run-out.
                    * Wide ball: Occurs when the ball is too wide for the batsman to reach with a normal cricket shot. The batting team gets an extra run but the batsman cannot be dismissed on that delivery.

                <div class="content">
                    The Decision Review System (DRS) in cricket is a technology-based system that helps umpires make accurate decisions. It allows players to challenge on-field decisions, such as LBW or caught dismissals. The DRS uses various technologies like:
 * UltraEdge: Detects faint sounds of the ball hitting the bat.
 * Hotspot: Detects heat signatures on the bat from the ball's impact.
 * Ball-tracking technology: Tracks the ball's trajectory to determine if it would have hit the stumps.
The third umpire reviews the replays and makes a final decision, ensuring fair play and minimizing errors.
