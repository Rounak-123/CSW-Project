                <div class="content">
                    The JEE is widely considered one of the most challenging engineering entrance exams in the world. Its difficulty level is high due to:
 * Conceptual Understanding: Requires a deep understanding of fundamental concepts in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.
 * Problem-Solving Skills: Demands the ability to apply concepts to solve complex and often unconventional problems.
 * Time Management: The exam has a strict time limit, forcing candidates to work efficiently and accurately under pressure.
 * Intense Competition: A large number of highly talented students compete for limited seats, making it a highly competitive exam.
However, the difficulty level can vary between different years and sessions. Some years might have easier papers, while others might be more challenging.
