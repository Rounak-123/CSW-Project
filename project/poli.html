                <div class="content">
                    The Indian Parliament is the supreme legislative body of the country. It consists of two houses: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The Lok Sabha members are directly elected by the people, while Rajya Sabha members are elected by state legislatures. The Parliament frames laws, controls finances, and oversees the executive. It also elects the President and Vice President. The President summons and prorogues Parliament sessions and can dissolve the Lok Sabha.

                <div class="content">
                    India follows a multi-party system with a parliamentary form of democracy. Elections are conducted by the independent Election Commission of India.
                    Eligibility: Citizens aged 18 and above can vote.

                    Voting Process:
                     * Verification: Voters present their ID card at the polling booth.
                     * Ink Mark: A unique indelible ink mark is applied to the voter's finger to prevent multiple voting.
                     * Ballot Paper/EVM: Voters receive a ballot paper or cast their vote on an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM).
                     * Secret Ballot: Voting is conducted in secret to ensure free and fair elections.
                     * Counting of Votes: After the polls close, votes are counted, and the results are declared.

                <div class="content">
                    NOTA stands for "None Of The Above." It is a voting option introduced in Indian elections to allow voters to express their dissatisfaction with all the candidates contesting in an election. By choosing NOTA, voters can indicate that they do not find any of the candidates suitable for the position.
                    While NOTA votes are counted, they are not considered valid votes and do not affect the election outcome. However, they serve as a significant tool for voters to voice their disapproval and hold political parties accountable.
                    The introduction of NOTA has been seen as a step towards empowering voters and enhancing democratic processes in India.

                <div class="content">
                    Article 370 was a provision in the Indian Constitution that granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It allowed the state to have its own constitution, flag, and autonomy in internal administration. This provision limited the applicability of the Indian Constitution to the state and restricted the jurisdiction of the Indian Parliament over the state.
                    However, on August 5, 2019, the Indian government revoked Article 370 and Article 35A, which was linked to it. This decision aimed to integrate Jammu and Kashmir more fully into the Indian Union and promote economic development and security in the region.
